# Hackerank 1-Month Kit (JavaScript)

All of the problems were solved by me using JavaScript and ES6 methods (no for loops)

## Installation

```JSX
git clone https://github.com/andrewvallejo/1month-hackerank
cd 1month-hackerank
yarn
```

## How to use

1. Find a file in the `hack` folder that you would want to see on the console
2. once you find it, type into the terminal `yarn nodemon hack/file-name.js`
